# Voice Recognition - Breif Theory

Turning speech into text using *Automatic Speech Recognition* (**ASR**)

- Uses machine learning to turn voice input into textual output

- Machine learning models based on voice input and textual meaning

---

# Voice Recognition - Breif Theory

Turn text into something actionable using *Natural Language Processing* (**NLP**) specifically *Natural Language Understanding* (**NLU**)

- Syntactic and semantic processing

- Text converted to intents and entities (synonyms)

**Example**: "I would like to fly from DCA to Chicago"

**Intent**: FindFlightIntent

**Entities**: DCA, Chicago

---

# Voice Recognition - Breif Theory

Natural Language Understanding is more than just parsing. One example is the application of synonyms.

**Example**: "I would like to fly from DCA to MDW"

  - MDW is the same as Chicago

**Example**: "I would like to fly from Washington, DC to MDW"

  - Washington, DC is the same as DCA

**Example**: "I would like to fly from Reagan to Chicago"

  - DCA is the same as Reagan International and even just Reagan

Disambiguation can be difficult

  - Washington, DC could be DCA or IAD

  - Chicago could be Midway, MDW, O'Hare or ORD

---

# Voice Recognition - Breif Theory

Responses can also benifit from NLP with using *Natural Language Generation* (**NLG**)

  - Pull in context around a given response instead of simplely generating a response based off a state machine

# Voice Recognition - Landscape

**Main Players**: Siri, Google, Cortana, Alexa

  - Each has a slightly different integration

  - Some are fenced like Siri with a limited set of interactions allowed

  - Alexa and Google are leaders

---

# Voice Recognition - Landscape

Amazon has also created the ability for hardware manufacturers to create their own device so Alexa can be integrated into non-Amazon devices

![Amazon devices](./avs-devices.png)

---

# Voice Recognition - Landscape

There are two acronyms you will see when looking at the Alexa developer documentation. 

*Alexa Voice Service* (**AVS**) 

   - This service enables the hardware integrations

   - The documentation for [Alexa Voice Service](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-voice-service/)

*Alexa Skills Kit* (**ASK**) 

  - This service enables the development of skills for Alexa

  - The documentation for [Alexa Skills Kit](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/ask-overviews/build-skills-with-the-alexa-skills-kit.html)


---

# Voice Recognition - Landscape

Amazon has also extracted two services that back Alexa that can be used independantly.

*AWS Lex*

  - Exposes the NLU system that backs Alexa

  - Documentation for [AWS Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/)

*AWS Polly*

  - Exposes the speech synthesis that backs Alexa

  - Documentation for [AWS Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/)

# Alexa Details - Alexa processing flow

Specifics of how Alexa uses voice recognition to process a request.

![flow](./alex-parse-example.png)

  1. User speaks

  2. Alexa device detects wake word 

  3. Alexa device sends audio stream to the Alexa service

  4. Alexa service applies ASR and NLU
  
  5. The invocation word is used to find the correct skill to call

  6. Your skill is invoked with the extracted Intent and Slots with their Entities

  7. A response is returned from the skill back to the Alexa service and streamed as speach back to the Alexa device

---

# Alexa Details - Skill development process

  1. Design a voice UI for the skill
  
  2. Gather the intents, utterances and slots needed for the skill
  
  3. Implementation
  
  4. Deploy and test

---

# Alexa Details - Advanced concepts

  - Contextual understanding - Examples would be using the previous request to understand the next request 
    or using the user's location to disambiguate a location.

  - Multimodal contextual understanding (video + voice, etc)

  - Alexa knows the difference between multiple speakers, a feature called "Your Voice"

  - "Natural skill interaction" allows dropping of the invocation name if the request
    context can be determined to match only one skill

---

# Skill Development - Basics

AWS Lambda is the prefered method of skill processing. Most of the examples you will find 
are written in Javascript but it isn't the only option available.

  - Another option is to use Python and [Flask Ask](https://github.com/johnwheeler/flask-ask)

The Alexa development portal is a seperate area from the AWS Lambda portal. There is a non-trival
process that is required to let the Alexa system communicate with a Lambda application, more about
that can be found in the [Custom Skills documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/host-a-custom-skill-as-an-aws-lambda-function.html)

  - Note that we will be using Heroku because it is free and easier to get started with.

---

# Skill Development - Intents

There are both custom and built in intents available to Skills.

  - A custom intent is given a name and that name will later be referenced in the code for the
    Skill. An example might be:

    ```GetHoroscope```

  - There are a number of built in intents that may be used to reduce the amount of work needed
    in setting up common requests. A couple examples are:

    - AMAZON.HelpIntent - A request for help

    - AMAZON.StopIntent - A request to stop the skill

    More can be found in the [built in intents document](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/standard-built-in-intents.html)

---

# Skill Development - Slots

There are both custom and built in slots available to Skills.

  - A custom slot will consist of a list of valid slot values. These values will be used to produce a model
    for the slot. For example you might create a custom slot type named *sign* as follows:

    ```
    Capricorn
    Aquarius
    Pisces
    Aries
    Taurus
    Gemini
    ```

  - There are a number of built in slot types that will fit a large number of needs. A couple examples are:

    - AMAZON.DATE - A slot that contains a date

    - AMAZON.NUMBER - A slot that contains a number

    More can be found in the [built in slot types document](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/slot-type-reference.html)

---

# Skill Development - Sample Utterances

  - Utterances help form the model for recognizing intents based on your intents
    and slots

  - The more sample utterances you have the more likely the model will be able to
    match a phrase that isn't exactly what is in one of the utterances

  - An example of a set of utterances:

  ```
  GetHoroscope the horoscope for {Sign} 
  GetHoroscope {Sign}
  GetHoroscope what's the horoscope for {Sign}
  GetHoroscope what is the horoscope for {Sign}
  GetHoroscope give me the horoscope for {Sign}
  GetHoroscope tell me the horoscope for {Sign}
  ```

---

# Skill Development - Responses

The response text that you give back to the Alexa skills service as a response to 
a request can generally be translated into speech well. In some cases you may want
to enhance it with one of the following options.

- SSML - Speech Synthesis Markup Language allows you to provide extra information 
  to the text to speech system such as reading a list of numbers as a single number
  or slowing down a set of words. An example would be:

```
  <speak>
    <say-as interpret-as="cardinal">12345</say-as>
  </speak>
```

- SSML also lets you send back pre-recorded audio. An example would be:

```
  <speak>
    <audio src="https://something.com/audio/welcome.mp3" /> 
  </speak>
```

# Voice UX/UI - General 

There are a number of places to apply UX/UI processes in designing an Alexa Skill.
The first two to know about are:

  - Voice-Only Interaction - Normal mode of operation

  - Voice with visual display - Alexa has cards that show up in the app

What follows is a very abrivated version of what can be found in the [Alexa designing
for voice](https://developer.amazon.com/designing-for-voice/) documentation.

---

# Voice UX/UI - Design Process 

Establish the purpose and user stories. The following are a couple parts of this process.

- What is the purpose of the skill? Why will people want to use it?

  - Example: *To provide a way to learn a subject through flash cards*

- What can a user do with the skill?

  - Example: *Ask for a random flash card*

---

# Voice UX/UI - Design Process 

Write scripts

- Scripts for voice interfaces are like wireframes for a visual user interface

- Create dialogs between the user and the skill

    ```
    User: Alexa, open flash card
    Alexa: Welcome to flash card. Would you like a flash card?
    User: Yes
    Alexa: What is the atomic mass of oxygen?
    User: Give me the answer
    Alexa: 15.999
    ...
    ```

- It can be helpful to record dialogs with another person

---

# Voice UX/UI - Design Process 

Develop the flow

- Outline the happy path flow first, this will be the shortest dialog to
  get to a completion and then build on that with variations

- Keep in mind that a user may be able to start anywhere in a flow so you
  will need to be able to fill in the blanks by reordering a dialog. For
  example:

  ```
  User: I want to fly to Chicago from DC
  Alexa: When do you wish to travel?
  ...
  ```

  or

  ```
  User: I want to go to Chicago
  Alexa: How do you want to get to Chicago?
  User: I want to fly there from DC
  Alexa: When do you wish to travel?
  ...
  ```

---

# Voice UX/UI - User Requests 

1. Finish designing before you build

2. Identify intents, Use the built-in intents

3. Identify utterances

4. Identify slots

---

# Voice UX/UI - Alexa Responses 

1. Be brief

2. Speak and write naturally

3. Use conversation markers

4. Add variety

5. Provide definitive choices

6. Handle problems

# Questions?

---

# Example Skill - Basics

- Flash card skill

  - User asks for a new card

  - Skill responds with a random card

  - User asks for the answer

  - Skill responds with the answer to the card

We will need to hold on to some state after the skill responds with the 
random card so we know what answer to give when asked.
